Building a language:
Tokenization -> Parsing -> AST Conversion -> static checks -> evaluate
How to define language elements is via grammar rules, eg:
add : '+' NUM ',' NUM ';';
num : [0-9] ;

Non-terminal symbol: a name for the new construct this grammar rule defines
Grammar rule operator: Seperates non-terminal defined from its definition
Grammar rule body: Defines sequences of constructs to match for the defined grammar element
Grammar rules end with semicolons
Single qupotes strings are token literals.
Parenthesis group sub-rule
+ is repition, * is zero or more, ? is optional element.
