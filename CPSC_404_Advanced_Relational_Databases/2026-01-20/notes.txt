Suppose users make the following nearly simultaneous requests for pages from these cylinders, and suppose the head assembly is currently on cyl. 165, have just come from cyl. 164.
    Order of arrivals = 1400, 2500, 170, 160, 161, 3500, 162, 170

Here is the service order for the following disk scheduling algorithms:
    FCFC: First come, First Served: 1400,2500,170,160,161,3500,162,170
    SSTF: Shortest seek time first: 162,161,160,170,170,1400,2500,3500
Which is more efficient and how would we measure efficiency?
    - Minimize the sum of seek distances
    - |165 - 162| + |162 - 161| + |160 + 170|
    - Minimize inefficiency for requests that have to wait.
    - Balance amount of data per user request (x cylinders vs one page)
    - Maximize throughput ()
    - Minimize elapsed time
Is there unfairness?
    - Long waits are possible.

The popular elevator algorithm sweeps back and forth across cylinders, servicing requests as they are encountered in both directions.
Assume we're on cyl. 165 having just come from cyl. 164, and all of a sudden we get this sequence:
    1400, 2500,170,160,161,3500,162,170.
What is the service order?
What is the updated service order if: While servicing cyl.1400 we suddenly get these new requests: 1250,170,1400,1500

Another variant: 
C-SCAN (Circular Scan)

    Here, we don't service new requests on the return trip; instead we zoom back to the beginning, and then service requests in one direction only. Why might this be advantageous?
